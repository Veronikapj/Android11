2. Google encourages developers to use the **Platform Stability milestone as a target for final compatibility testing and public release**

3. It gives us **enough time to test and debug features on the Android 11** before the OS is open to the public. (especially testing on new Android 11 is critical to the SDK developers)

4. Once 11 is released, the required targetSDK version is 10. (n-1), as Google would like to give maximum time to adapt apps.
